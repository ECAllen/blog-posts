# Adding a netbook section to hugo powered blog

I like to keep notes using a program called (Keepnote)[http://keepnote.org/manual/]. The nice thing about it is that it stores the notes in html. I wanted to add the notes to my Hugo powered blog. In order to do this I am going to utilize (shortcodes)[https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/] in Hugo.
