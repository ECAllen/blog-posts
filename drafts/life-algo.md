# Intro

put in some stuff about myself

## Algo

### Step 1

As much as possible ask "What am I doing now?". Do this until you are constantly doing it throughout the day. Do not alter your behaviour. Simply notice what is happening. Like so many problems in life awareness is the first step. 

Why is it important not to alter you behaviour when you notice that you are wasting time? Because we dont want to setup a negative association with the noticing. In other words if ask what you are doing and you realize you are lazing about then you will feel guilty about not doing what you are supposed to be doing. This will build up negative feelings. These feelings will make your mind not want to do the practice. This practice is the bedrock for everything else to come. 

There are some mental tricks you can use to keep from building negative feelings. One of them is to ignore your goals for a while... maybe a week, maybe a month. I know you are probably resistent to this idea. But think of it this way, if you temporarily give up your your goals for long term gains then you will come out ahead. Also if you were so good at achieving your goals then you probably wouldnt need this book. You should only put your goals aside if you notice a build up of negative feelings about the practice.   

If you do this enough then you will get a feeling of surfacing, as if coming up for air then diving down again and losing awareness.

### Step 2

Daily goal with feedback mechanism. Seinfeld calendar. At first do little bullshit things even if they dont move you much closer to finish line. The point is not necessarily to be effective but rather to build the habit. 

Signs you are ready to move to the next step. You feel urge to do something when you havent done your daily task. You find yourself doing your daily task early to get it out of the way. 

### Step 3 

Daily review of effectiveness and tomorrow's plan.  

Ongoing list of daily accomplishments

Only items that give leveragei or potentially give leverage go on the accomplishments list.

For instance cleaning the house does not go on the accomlishements list but writing a blog post does.
